Shazana Davis	2	3	2	1	You write very well and passionately about your subject, however I would have liked to see you dig into the historical events is a deeper way. Would like to have seen a bit more discussion of conditions for women during and after WWII, as well as a deeper exploration of the class issues inherent in women of color providing childcare for women who did not work having to find care for their own children and how that was handed without formal daycare centers. Also, the Mexican-American War happened from 1846-1848, so it has nothing to do with your discussion of events in the 1970s. Not sure what happened there! Would be much more useful to discuss 20th century anti-Mexican sentiment, like the border inspections during WWI or the Zoot Suit Riots of 1943. Using Skidmore to provide an example of a mixed race person playing up their whiteness to hide their Mexican identity could have been useful, but you should have placed it in the correct spot in the paper and actually written about the example.I also would have loved if your discussion of American takes on capitalism and their effect on child care availability had been further up in the paper and expanded upon, not just shoved in the conclusion. 
Demba Traore	5	5	5	2	This paper has nothing to do with the reseearch and proposal you passed in and really nothing to do with history at all. Did you decide to try to pass in the same paper for 2 different classes? Very disappointed.
David Brice-Wattson	2	4	3	2	I can tell you were excited to work on this topic and I am glad about that. I think this paper works best when you focus on discussing the role of women and the accomplishments of the Panthers. Why did you call Mussolini and his Blackshirts similar to the BPP? They're on opposite sides of the political spectrum, had very different goals, and were working in very different countries. I don't teach about Mussolini because it is a good organization I think you should know about. I teach it because facism was a significant movement in the 20th century that led the world toward a massive World War. That's not an endorsement. I understand that you are frustrated about the treatment of the BPP by police and government forces, and that's totally valid. But I want to see you tell me WHY the BPP is important, not compare them to another group that used violence to intimidate people into getting their way. That's not like the Panthers. Were you trying to tie the topic into the class material? There's better stuff to do that with - what about all the decolonization content we talked about at the end of class? I talked about the BPP as a new phase in Black American liberatory struggles and discussed how they inspired other groups like the Young Lords - would have been great to see you reference that. What about the legacy of slavery we spoke about for weeks at the beginning of the semester? That legacy is part of what the Panthers are struggling against. What about comparing this Black struggle to the Haitian Revolution? There's so much you could have discussed!
Sam Piccone	3	2	2	2	You've identified an interesting idea here - you're right, we don't spend much time at all in survey history classes looking at women after they get the right to vote - we cover that fight, often too briefly, and then move on. You make an impassioned argument to go deeper into women's history, but I would have liked it if you have taken your own advice! I wish you had delved a bit deeper into the examples you use. Sometimes you sort of mention something was important without really explaining what it was or giving an example. For example, how did women's political engagement change politics in the first decade after suffrage? You say it did, and you say the previous ways of counting participation were flawed, but don't give any examples of how. Your paper would be much richer if you spent some time discussing things in more detail. You do include some nice connections to the course materials, but you missed an opportunity to easily connect white women's attempts to deny the vote to immigrants to other exclusionary laws aimed at immigrants in the same period from when we discussed New Imperialism. Why do you only give citations for some of the quotations you include? This is not acceptable - you must cite every time you use another person's work.
Justin Huang	2	3	2	1	Good use of secondary sources, but really limited connections to the course materials. You could have discussed some of the pros and cons of the revolution or some of the primary sources we looked at.
Esther Cherny	1	2	2	2	Very nice! I like how you look at the different types of use of radio from all different angles of war. Some unclear sentence structure makes it a bit difficult to understand your writing at times, but in all, pretty good.
Jonathan Yarmusevich	3	3	3	4	Love your enthusiasm for your topic. Really need to work on your sentence structure and readability. Some vague and hasty references to class content. Insufficient/poorly done citations.
Kayla Worrell	1	2	1	1	Very nicely written and argued. I would have loved to see some connective tissue filling in the years between the Morgan article and your primary source - that's hundreds of years of racial formation and the legacy of slavery sort of getting skipped over! You could have used the sack from Tiya Miles' All That She Carried to make that chronological link while making a connection between this bag and the pocketbooks you bring up next. Also, your conclusion doesn't really restate the claim about fashion that you were trying to argue in particular. But in all, nice work. FYI: Tanisha Ford is a professor at the CUNY Graduate Center in Manhattan. If you keep an eye out, you might be able to catch her at a lecture or book talk sometime. 
Tyra Frank	1	4	3	1	This is very nicely written and argued, however it does not include any reference to class materials.
Christina Mo	1	1	1	1	Well written and argued. Excellent choice of primary source.
Qing Long Li	3	4	3	3	If you have decided to examiine the relationships between the Allied Forced during and after WWII, it seems important to mention how economic systems - choosing Capitalism or Communism - influenced those relationships. FYI - The Berlin Wall was built almost 15 years after the Berlin Airlift occurred. Improper/missing citations.
Muhammad Sajjad	1	3	2	2	Passionately written and reasonably well argued, though you sometimes just say someone else's work demonstrates a proof wihtout actually citing the section that speaks to your argument. Other times you use quotations to excellent effect, so this seems like maybe you were just rushed in places. It would have been useful and clarifying if you had taken a paragraph at the top to explain who Balfour was, when the Declaration specifically said, and the circumstances around its creation/adoption. You've mentioned Patrick Wolfe in the text, but don't give a citation for him or include him in your works cited...? I also think you don't give much consideration to how much antisemitism influenced the political choices of Britain and the US, which seems like it would be important here. 
Sabrena Hassan	2	2	2	1	Considering that we had such trouble finding you a primary source you wanted to work with, this turned out pretty good! I am surprised you never included Nazi censorship in your paper, since you did extend beyond US borders by including Tenochitlan. Looking at how Fanon's writing influenced revolutionaries in the US and around the world might have been a good line of thought to consider as well, and you seem to have come up a bit short in terms of sources, so that's too bad. Very well written and argued, though.
Finn Latici-McAvoy	1	2	1	1	Nicely done, very well written and argued. It's interesting that you have another example of homosexuality being used to damage a communistn here in Guatemala. Would have been a good spot to connect the US Red & Lavender Scares from class to your paper.
Gittel Hahn	2	3	3	2	Passionately written. I would have liked you to do more "showing" of Pauline's exploits to illustrate her contributions instead of just "telling" us that the book has that information in it. No intext citations.
Bilel Diallo	2	3	1	1	For the most part, this is well written. I don't quite understand why you've decided to compare teaching the Boston Massacre to teaching the Industrial Revolution. Would it not make more sense to critique the content taught during the Age of Revolutions section instead, suggesting that we focus more on the Boston Massacre and less on say, the French revolution or the Prince Hall article? And only 3 secondary sources? What happened?
Bahora Umurzakova	2	3	3	3	Presentation looks good but there are some issues. The Industrial Revolution started well before the 1920s, so why is this chart useful for helping us understand the effects of the IR? I would have liked you to have included some discussing of "The Spark," rather than just pasting the screenshots there for us to read. Would like to have seen some actual quotations fromthe Ashley Mines Commission that supported your point instead of just including the gloss from the document. BTW, Lord Ashley was a man, not a women. You've made a good observation about the Lowell Mill Girls source, though I don;t understand why you included the quote from Brownson, since that really is an argument against what you are aruging here... I did say that if you chose a project, I wanted it presented by you, not just a set of slides. You make some interesting points and I wonder if it would not have been better for you to have just done a paper, especially if you were not going to give a presentation.
Aidan Ramirez	2	2	2	2	You've taken on a difficult topic and tried to see both sides, which is admirable and also makes it a great candidate for a subject hat should be covered in this class! Would like to see you ground your discussion of the Balfour Declaration in World War I, which was when it was made, and when the Sykes-Picout agreement was made, which is what you are showing a map of here. Some of your explanations are a bit muddled. Glad you gave me the slides seprarately, because your video got cut off before you got to your conclusion. 
Samaya Kanu	1	2	1	2	This is a really great presentation! It's varied and engaging and I like that you shift back and forth between your slides and you. Wish the section on Ida B. Wells included discussion of her anti-lynching work! You get so passionate when you get to talk about Harlem! That is awesome to see. Good use of music, too. I do see that some of the sources are internet sources, not academic sources, but they are used to good effect. 
Antar Das	2	1	2	1	Well laid out presentation, though I wonder if you would have benefited from being a paper instead. You should not give the war you are discussion as an example of the issue you are arguing. Come up with a different third example. Futher, you should tell us what your examples are - both of those examples are when a group of people rebel against their own governments - that's not the case here. An interesting question to consider is, is it the money or is it the war guilt? If the guilt was throughly removed from the negotiated agreement, would the money have seemed so bad? Or if Germany had joined the League right away, would that have shifted how Germany felt about their position in the world or increaed their bargaining power?
William Perez-Rodriguez	3	4	3	2	Good thesis. I like how you broke down the takeaways from the primary source, but I wish we had a couple quotes from the article to look at. I also wish you had included quotations from the secondary sources you reference. That's what sort of moves you away from giving a book report and into actually using other author's works to shore up your own argument. I wish you had told us about the other images you shared!
Ellen Toeroek	3	3	3	2	I am glad you submitted something, though I am confused why you did not send me the recording you made, too?! I think the work you've done is evident, and it's really interesting. I do think that we're missing a little bit of your analysis here, why these quotations are important, how they fit into the conversation you and your nother are having. I also think a bit more research into the two different goverments your mother experienced in Peru would have been helpful. I think we need a bit more connective tissue here to really land it.
Ashawn Rose	4	2	1	5	I'm a little confused about how things went so wrong with your presentation - a voice memo or something would have been fine. Buit I am so glad you redid it, because this was really great, with some caveats. You chose a good format for your argument! That said, I don't have a transcript or script here so there's no works cited or citations, and I don't really know if you have been incorporating secondary sources into your program, meaning there's a big hit in the Communication score. You've used audio clips here to good effect. I especially like how you drew the relationship between Hitler, Haber, and your topic. Wish there had been more class materials referenced.
