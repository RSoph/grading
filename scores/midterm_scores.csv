Gittel Hahn	5	1	1	1	15	This is really nice except that it neglects to incorporate other class materials to support your points. (And it was incredibly late.) Very well written, with attention paid to citing your sources correctly.
Alexander Montero	4	3	3	4	0	As we discussed when we spoke about this after class, you did not follow all the directions for the midterm, finding your own sections to Locke to discuss, etc. This impacts the grade. The other main issue here, however, is that you have not made connections to other class materials as support for your arguement. While I do appreciate that you felt a personal connection to the sources you chose, personal reflections were not what the midterm was about. Also, you did not do Part I of the assignment.
