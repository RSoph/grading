Fangzhi Chen	3	2	2	3	0	Very few sources from course used to support your claim. Where are your PAPER questions?
Donovan Justin	3	3	1	2	10	Passionately written, but limited use of sources to prove claim. Where is your works cited? Partial credit for PAPER analysis since you did not complete it, but you did a nice job of answering what questions you did.
Luis Batista	5	3	2	2	15	Were you in class the day we discussed the reading about Ashley's sack? It would have been useful for you to go back and review the lectures/notes from the days we discussed these documents. No use of additional class sources to provide evidence. Works cited does not follow MLA form.
Christian Hoyek	3	2	3	2	15	Very limited used of class sources to provide evidence for your claim.
Alfonso Abreu	3	2	2	3	15	Limited use of class materials to provide evidence for your claim. And it seems like you did consult some sources for part of you claim, but failed to cite them. Where is your works cited?
Talia Thompson	6	6	6	6	15	Where is your works cited?
Jovensky Sainvillier	3	2	2	2	15	Great effort. You've been very thoughtful about your sources. But your use of class materials is very limited. You even mentioned some articles in Part One that you did not end up using in your essay. What happened there? Also no works cited.
Kevin Davis	2	2	2	2	15	You've written passionately about these sources, but you have neglected a lot of the citations that would have made your work stronger. Also I'm concerned about how you are defining primary and secondary sources. See my note in the paper.
